# github-markdown-child-pages

## Problem

Markdown doesn't provide for any sort of child-pages capability to generate any sort of navigatable hierarchy, forcing one to manually create (and, ugh, update) said links over time. (This is really a step down from other page-management systems.)

For a directory with the following contents:

```
./children.sh
./untracked.txt
./README.md
./tracked.txt
./dir/subdir/subsubdir/untracked-file.txt
./dir/subdir/subsubdir/tracked.txt
./dir/subdir/README.md
./dir/README.md
```

I want to provide an easy-to-discover entry into the documentation child pages.

<!-- github-markdown-child-pages-start -->
&#9122; [github-markdown-child-pages](./README.md)<br>
&#9123; dir<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9122; [The Top Level](./dir/README.md)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9123; subdir<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9123; [Something Nested Within](./dir/subdir/README.md)<br>
<table><tr><td><small><i>Generated by <a href="https://github.com/mickeys/github-markdown-child-pages?ts=4">github-markdown-child-pages</a></i>.</small></td></tr></table>
<!-- github-markdown-child-pages-end -->


## Solution
A bare-bones bash script, [children.sh](./children.sh), that generates a graphical representation of nested folders and providing hyperlinks to Markdown documents with the document title as the link text.

## Overview

Rather than re-enginering I provide a wrapper around the UNIX `tree` command to output Markdown. In this repo I created nesting folders with Markdown files to demonstrate; the resulting output looks like:

## Usage

Please refer to the comprehensive [man page](./README.md) for operation and available options.

## Future usage & directions

The output is wrapped by markers:

```
<!-- github-markdown-child-pages-start -->
<!-- github-markdown-child-pages-end -->
```

and it's my hope that once you've added the above in all the Markdown files to which you want child
listings I'll be able to recursively traverse a nested folders of git repositories, cleaning out the existing content between the markers and replace with a current version. For the moment I'm content with being able to generate a child-page listing for my existing repos, some of which are filled with a variety of related items.

| TO-DO CANDIDATES |
|:--- |
| As mentioned above, recurse through a hierarchy, updating the child-page listings. |
| Add a command-line switch to include the first paragraph of a child Markdown file into the listing as a teaser. |
